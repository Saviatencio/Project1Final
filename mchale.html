At the age of 14 he took up a Saturday job at the local fishmonger, where he learned about filleting fish and the wonders of Scottish shellfish.<br>
		He worked in restaurant kitchens across Glasgow from a young age, before traveling to gain experience at some of the best restaurants across the world. He spent time at marque in Sydney, completed a stage at Rene Redzepi's iconic noma and worked under tom Aiken at his eponymous Michelin-starred restaurant on Elystan street, finally joining Brett Graham's opening team at the Ledbury. Over six years, he played a part in the restaurant’s gaining first one then two Michelin stars, rising to the role of development chef for the esteemed restaurant.<br>
		Eager to forge his own path forward, he gained plaudits cooking as part of the experimental young turks collective, eventually opening the clove club in shoreditch town hall in 2013.<br>
		Isaac is an active part of the international chef community, and appears around the world regularly giving keynote speeches, cooking demonstrations and collaborating on special dinners and events.<br></p>
